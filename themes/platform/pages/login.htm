                    We have launched the first demo version of the CryptoPolice Academy! The team has done an
                    outstanding job in order to show its combat readiness in the early stages of the project. The
                    Academy is the core of the CryptoPolice platformâ€™s Officer training process. At the moment the
                    Academy is filled with demo materials for you to get acquainted with the CryptoPolice platform's
                    training system.
