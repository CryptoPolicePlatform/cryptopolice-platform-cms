                        We have launched the first demo version of the CryptoPolice Academy! The team has done an outstanding job in order to show its combat readiness in the early stages of the project. The Academy is the core of the CryptoPolice platformâ€™s process to train Officers. At the moment, the Academy features demo materials for you to get to know the CryptoPolice platform's training system.
